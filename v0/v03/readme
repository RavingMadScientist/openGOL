gsquares8 automates the texture-populating routine, providing now 4 characters which can be written

in gsquares7, we will introduce multiple shaders, so that the squares display text and the triangles do not.

at present, gsquares6 is the most advanced incarnation of our font explorations. 
the collection of squares can be set to all print the letter 'g', or the letter 'h'.
