A summary of the version history of the OpenGameOfLife:


v0.4 integrates the text rendering of v0.3 with the logic / graphics of v0.1

v0.3 successfully implements the functionality desired from v0.2 using the impressively hardheaded technique of directly encoding a subset of ASCII characters as raw textures, which are applied to transparent rectangles transformed against the current Window specs.
It is implemented in the gsquares91 source/executable, and the font is found in textLib.c


v0.2 was a failed attempt to add a fixed-position information display in the top-left of the view window. It relied upon a legacy funct
ion family (glutStroke/BitmapCharacter) which works in immediate mode, but is rather unfortunately silently ignored in the Modern Core Profile 3.3 sp
ec. Thus, it is not compatible with shaders.


version0.1 was the first incarnation of GOL capable of reading input files, and outputting green squares on a 2D grid of user-specified size.
 It evolves every time the 'f' key is pressed, and then user can navigate the camera around the grid using the arrow keys.
