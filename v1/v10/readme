so far, the useful scripts within this directory are:




rotateCube3.c merely adds the top and bottom to the rotateCube2 objects.

rotateCube2.c is very functional- this is the first working incarnation of a 3-axis 3D rotation capability for user-defined navigation
It displays two cubes with the tops and bottoms cut off , intersected by a square.

rotateCube.c is nonfunctional

greatDummy.c provides a working openGL display context that seems idealized for my purposes, ie rendering multiple instances of numerous definable objects
